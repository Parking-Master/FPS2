FPS2 is the all-new FPS, taken to the next level. A whole-new gaming experience with 4+ more maps, original characters and weapons, and a modern FPS feel.

## About
Why is FPS 2 better than the original?
### #1: Performance
The original FPS was a great fun game with lots of features and misc, but when it comes to performance, then it's a whole nother story.

#### FPS 1
- Choppiness: 5/10
- Battery Usage: 9/10
- Data usage: 9/10

#### FPS 2
- Choppiness: 2/10
- Battery Usage: 4/10
- Data usage: 3/10

If you add all of the lists together, then times it by 2, you'll get the total performance

#### FPS 1
- Total performance: 46/100

#### FPS 2
- Total performance: 18/100

As you can see, FPS 2 has a much less impact on performance, even in multiplayer.

### #2: Style

Obviously, new game can't be completely similar style-wise to the last one, we've make a huge change to menus, in-game UI, and much more.

</details>

A lot of responsiveness has also been added not only for resize, but for touch support and spacing elements.

### #3: Features and Misc
There's not much to say about the features, because we tried are hardest for full customization and other features in the original game.

For the maps though, we brought back some old maps, and brought in some new maps. Some maps in the last game could not be added for in-game support reasons.
